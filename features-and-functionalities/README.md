# Airbnb Clone Backend: Features and Functionalities

## Overview
This document outlines the key features and functionalities required for the backend of the Airbnb Clone project, as part of the **Backend Blueprint: Feature Foundations** task. The backend is designed to support a rental marketplace with user management, property listings, bookings, payments, and more, ensuring a scalable, secure, and efficient system.

## Features and Functionalities Document
The detailed list of backend features and functionalities is documented in a diagram created using Draw.io. The diagram is exported as a PNG file and stored in the `features-and-functionalities/` directory.
